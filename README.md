# elm-pdf

Generate PDF files!

This package is intended as a baby step in the direction of one day having a useful package for creating PDFs.

Currently it supports:
- Encoding ascii text with manually placed line breaks
- And also JPG images

If this package is missing a feature you need (it almost certainly is), then make an issue about it.
I can't promise I'll implement it but it's good to know what people have for use cases.

Pull requests are also welcome!
